## Before you do anything

### 1. Read your operating instructions

Open **[agentic/instructions.md](agentic/instructions.md)** — it tells you what files to load, in what order, and based on what task type.

### 2. Before writing ANY documentation or diagrams

You **MUST** read and follow the style guides. These are not optional — they define formatting, structure, citations, accessibility, and visual standards for every document and diagram in this project.

| What you're creating       | Read FIRST                                                         | Then                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Any `.md` file**         | [agentic/markdown_style_guide.md](agentic/markdown_style_guide.md) | Check [templates](agentic/markdown_templates/) for your doc type                                                                                          |
| **Any Mermaid diagram**    | [agentic/mermaid_style_guide.md](agentic/mermaid_style_guide.md)   | Open the [specific diagram type file](agentic/mermaid_diagrams/)                                                                                          |
| **A PR record**            | [agentic/markdown_style_guide.md](agentic/markdown_style_guide.md) | Use [PR template](agentic/markdown_templates/pull_request.md) → save to `docs/project/pr/`                                                                |
| **An issue record**        | [agentic/markdown_style_guide.md](agentic/markdown_style_guide.md) | Use [issue template](agentic/markdown_templates/issue.md) → save to `docs/project/issues/`                                                                |
| **A kanban board**         | [agentic/markdown_style_guide.md](agentic/markdown_style_guide.md) | Use [kanban template](agentic/markdown_templates/kanban.md) → save to `docs/project/kanban/`                                                              |
| **An ADR/decision record** | [agentic/markdown_style_guide.md](agentic/markdown_style_guide.md) | Use [decision template](agentic/markdown_templates/decision_record.md) → save to `agentic/adr/` (global) or subsystem `adr/` (for example `.crewai/adr/`) |

### 3. Key rules you must follow

**Documentation:**

- **One H1 per document.** Emoji on H2 headings only (one per H2). No emoji on H3/H4. No H5+.
- **Cite everything.** Every external claim gets a footnote citation with full URL.
- **Diagrams over prose.** If content describes flow, structure, or relationships — add a Mermaid diagram.
- **`accTitle` + `accDescr`** on every Mermaid diagram. `classDef` color classes only — no inline `style`, no `%%{init}`.
- **Horizontal rule after every `</details>` block.**

**Code:**

- **Scoped Conventional Commits** for all commit messages — `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(auth): add OAuth2 flow`, `fix(api): handle timeout`). Scope is strongly recommended; see [contribute_standards.md](agentic/contribute_standards.md) for full format including body, footers, and breaking change conventions.
- **Multi-line commit bodies are required** for non-trivial changes. The body must explain **why** the change was made, **what** key files were touched, and **how** behavior differs. The commit history is the authoritative record of the project — someone reading `git log` alone should fully understand every change.
- **License and attribution are mandatory in redistributions** — this repo is Apache-2.0. Keep `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` when redistributing derivative works, and preserve attribution to Superior Byte Works, LLC / Clayton Young (Boreal Bytes).
- **No warranty / no liability** — do not add language in docs or code comments that contradicts Apache-2.0 warranty and liability disclaimers.
- **Example secret placeholders are acceptable** — `*.env.example` may contain clearly fake sample values; flag only real credential leakage or unsafe secret handling.
- **Run local CI before commit/push when possible** — run `./scripts/ci-local.sh` (or `./scripts/ci-local.sh --review` when review behavior changed) before committing/pushing unless the user explicitly says not to.
- **If local CI cannot run in this environment** (missing local secrets/tools, hosted remote runner), document the skip reason in PR/issue records and proceed with available checks.
- **Draft PR first** → design checkpoint → implement → code review → human marks Ready
- **PR records are files** in `docs/project/pr/pr-NNNNNNNN-short-description.md` — not GitHub UI data
- **GitHub PR body must contain only the full branch URL to the PR record file** (for example, `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/docs/project/pr/pr-NNNNNNNN-short-description.md`)
- **Never** merge, deploy, access secrets, force-push, or approve your own PR

**Everything is Code:**

- PRs, issues, and kanban boards are **markdown files in `docs/`**, not data locked in GitHub's UI
- The file is the source of truth. GitHub is the comment/review layer.
- See [ADR-003](agentic/adr/ADR-003-everything-is-code.md) for the full rationale.

## Progress sync loop (mandatory)

Use this loop so humans can monitor work in real time from repo files.

1. **Before implementation starts**: update the active PR file, issue file(s), and kanban board with scope, plan, and `in progress` status.
2. **Before touching real implementation files**: ensure PR/issue/kanban reflect exactly what you are about to change and why.
3. **After each logical milestone** (not just at the end): update PR/issue/kanban with progress, decisions, blockers, and changed scope.
4. **Before running verification/tests**: update PR/issue/kanban with expected validation steps and current status, then run `./scripts/ci-local.sh` when local environment supports it.
5. **After verification/tests**: update PR/issue/kanban with pass/fail evidence and next actions.

Do not treat tracking files as end-of-task paperwork; they are live operational status for humans.

---

## Task completion gate (mandatory final step)

Before declaring any task complete, update the repo's source-of-truth records.

1. **Update PR record** in `docs/project/pr/pr-NNNNNNNN-short-description.md` to reflect what changed and what remains.
2. **Update issue record(s)** in `docs/project/issues/` when status, scope, root cause, or verification changes.
3. **Update kanban board** in `docs/project/kanban/` for movement across backlog/in-progress/review/done.
4. **Create or update ADRs** in the correct decision log when a change introduces a durable decision:
   - `agentic/adr/` for repo-wide or cross-subsystem decisions,
   - subsystem `adr/` directories for local implementation decisions (for example `.crewai/adr/`),
   - cross-cutting decisions discovered in a subsystem must also be mirrored in `agentic/adr/`.

If no ADR is needed, explicitly state `No ADR required` in the PR record rationale.

This enforces **single source of truth**: GitHub is the review surface; repository files are the authoritative record.
